# eCommerceConsoleApp

Console Application that allows a user to register, login, purchase, and return items. Currently, if user purchases 3 or more items, the application automatically sets one of the item's purchase date to February, to allow functionality of return restrictions (User can only return an item if the purchase date is 3 months or less than current date).
